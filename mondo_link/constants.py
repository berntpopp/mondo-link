#: Bumped whenever the on-disk SQLite schema changes. v2 added xref.object_label
#: (the target term's human-readable name, from SSSOM); a rebuild populates it.

#: The Mondo ontology root term ("disease or disorder").
MONDO_ROOT = "MONDO:0000001"

#: Root of Mondo's non-human-animal disease branch. Its descendants are veterinary
#: terms (e.g. "Marfan syndrome, FBN1-related, pig"); the resolver demotes them below
#: human terms in the fuzzy fallback so a human-disease query is not led by livestock.
NON_HUMAN_ANIMAL_ROOT = "MONDO:0005583"

#: Hard cap on items accepted by a single batch tool call (bounds token blowup /
#: abuse). Surfaced in capabilities.limits and enforced by the batch tools.
MAX_BATCH_ITEMS = 50

#: Cross-ontology prefixes surfaced as first-class xref sources -- the CLOSED vocabulary
#: ``map_cross_ontology.prefixes`` filters over. Declared as a ``Literal`` so an ``enum``
#: appears in the tool's input schema and pydantic rejects an unrecognised source BEFORE
#: the body runs (schema == runtime); the tuple is DERIVED from it, never a second copy.
#: get_disease still surfaces every xref group (incl. ICD/EFO/...); only the map filter is
#: constrained to this first-class set, so the schema never promises more than it accepts.

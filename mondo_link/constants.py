#: The Mondo ontology root term ("disease or disorder").
MONDO_ROOT = "MONDO:0000001"

#: Root of Mondo's non-human-animal disease branch. Its descendants are veterinary
#: terms (e.g. "Marfan syndrome, FBN1-related, pig"); the resolver demotes them below
#: human terms in the fuzzy fallback so a human-disease query is not led by livestock.
NON_HUMAN_ANIMAL_ROOT = "MONDO:0005583"

#: Hard cap on items accepted by a single batch tool call (bounds token blowup /
#: abuse). Surfaced in capabilities.limits and enforced by the batch tools.

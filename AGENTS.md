# AGENTS.md — mondo-link

Guidance for agents and contributors working in this repository.

## What this is

`mondo-link` is an MCP + REST server that grounds disease work in the Mondo
Disease Ontology. It builds a local SQLite index from the Mondo OBO + SSSOM
releases and serves read-only tools for disease lookup, the `is_a` hierarchy,
and cross-ontology mapping. It mirrors the sibling `mgi-link` stack/architecture.

## Two planes (non-negotiable boundary)

- **Data plane** — `config.py`, `constants.py`, `identifiers.py`, `ingest/`,
  `data/`, `services/`. Downloads the Mondo release (conditional GET), atomically
  builds the SQLite index (terms, labels, synonyms, definitions, `is_a` closure,
  merged OBO + SSSOM cross-references with provenance + predicate,
  deprecated/`replaced_by`), and **returns plain dicts**. It raises typed
  exceptions from `mondo_link.exceptions`; it never builds error envelopes.
- **MCP plane** — `mcp/`. Domain-agnostic scaffolding shared with siblings.
  `run_mcp_tool` (in `mcp/envelope.py`) owns `success` / `_meta` and converts
  exceptions into **returned** structured errors (never raised to the client).

## Invariants

- Services return plain dicts; the envelope owns `success`/`_meta` and returns
  structured errors. **7-code error taxonomy**: `invalid_input`, `not_found`,
  `ambiguous_query`, `data_unavailable`, `rate_limited`, `upstream_unavailable`,
  `internal_error`.
- Every response carries `_meta.next_commands` (ready-to-call follow-ups).
- Every tool declares `output_schema` + `READ_ONLY_OPEN_WORLD` annotations, and
  its first description sentence is a discovery summary ending with
  `Signature: tool(args...)`.
- **Every tool's real output (success + error, all response modes) must validate
  against its own `output_schema`** — enforced by `tests/unit/test_output_schemas.py`.
  Grouped-by-prefix payloads (`xrefs`, `mappings`) are objects keyed by prefix, not
  arrays; declare them as objects or the envelope leaks a raw validation error.
- `response_mode` ∈ `minimal | compact | standard | full`. List tools also carry a
  pagination block (`total`/`returned`/`limit`/`offset`/`truncated`/`next_offset`);
  when truncated, `_meta.next_commands` offers a forward-page step (advance `offset`).
- Every `_meta` echoes `capabilities_version` (a hash of the discovery contract) so
  warm clients can skip re-fetching `get_server_capabilities`.
- Keep `mcp/capabilities.py::TOOLS` in sync with the registered tool set
  (`tests/unit/test_tool_names.py` enforces this).
- Identifiers are normalised in `identifiers.py` (`MONDO:NNNNNNN`; external
  CURIEs case-folded, `Orphanet` → `ORPHA`).
- Ground every claim in the local index and cite the MONDO id + Mondo release
  version (`mondo_version` is echoed in record payloads).

## Definition of done

`make ci-local` must be green:

```
format-check   ruff format --check
lint-ci        ruff check
lint-loc       scripts/check_file_size.py   (≤ 500 lines/file, hard cap)
typecheck      mypy --strict
test-fast      pytest -n auto, coverage ≥ 80%
```

`tests/unit/test_output_schemas.py` runs inside `test-fast` and is the gate
against the grouped-payload schema leak (every tool's real output — success and
error, all response modes — must validate against its own `output_schema`). After
a redeploy, also run `make verify-deploy URL=<server>/diagnostics`: it pipes the
live `get_diagnostics` into `scripts/check_deployed_freshness.py` and exits
non-zero unless `build.git_sha` matches local HEAD — the guard against shipping a
green local tree whose fixes never reached the running container.

## Conventions

- Python 3.12+, `uv`, hatchling. Add deps via `pyproject.toml`, then `uv lock`.
- `structlog` logs to **stderr only** — stdout is reserved for the stdio MCP
  protocol. Never `print` to stdout outside the CLI.
- Files stay under 500 lines; split by responsibility, not layer.
- TDD: write the failing test first. Keep unit tests self-contained (build a
  fixture SQLite from `load_schema_sql()` or `tests/fixtures/`).
- Frozen contracts: `mcp/` scaffolding, `ingest/schema.sql`, and the
  `MondoService` / `MondoRepository` signatures are the seams other modules code
  against — change them deliberately.

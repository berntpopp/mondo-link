## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Per-call clinical-use disclaimer (`_meta.unsafe_for_clinical_use`):** every
  MCP tool response now carries `"unsafe_for_clinical_use": true` in `_meta`,
  on both the success and error envelope paths, at every `response_mode`
  (`minimal` included, which otherwise strips `_meta` down to `{tool,
  request_id}`). Previously the research-use / not-clinical-decision-support
  notice was surfaced only once via `get_server_capabilities`
  (`research_use_only` / `research_use_notice`, still present and unchanged);
  this fleet-wide disclaimer standardization makes the notice visible on the
  response an LLM client actually reads, per call. Purely additive: no
  existing `_meta` key is renamed, removed, or restructured.

### Security

- Adopt the GeneFoundry Container & Deployment Hardening Standard v1: digest-pinned
  base image, `.dockerignore`, read-only rootfs + tmpfs scratch + writable data
  volume, `cap_drop: ALL`, `no-new-privileges`, `init`, mem/cpu/pids limits on the
  base compose, a new expose-only `docker-compose.prod.yml`, and a CI container
  scan + SBOM workflow (Trivy). Also fetch the Mondo OBO release over `https://`
  (scheme only; no checksum infra changes).
- **Inbound-boundary hardening:** the base `docker-compose.yml` now loopback-binds
  the published host port (`127.0.0.1:…`) so copying it to a server never publishes
  the unauthenticated backend on the public IP (production still fronts it via the
  prod/npm overlays, `ports: !reset []`). Credentialed CORS is disabled
  (`allow_credentials=False`) — mondo-link holds no cookies/session, so it was
  meaningless — and the app now fails closed at startup on the
  `allow_credentials=True` + wildcard-origin footgun. The unauthenticated
  diagnostics surface and the data-refresh logs now report the db **filename**
  only, never the absolute on-disk path (no filesystem-layout leak). Both compose
  and CORS guards are locked by new unit tests.

### Token-efficiency pass

- **Tiered `_meta` by `response_mode` (token tax):** the per-call `_meta` block is
  now sized to the requested verbosity instead of repeating everything on every
  call. `minimal` returns only `{tool, request_id}`; `compact` (default) keeps
  `next_commands` (workflow guidance) and `capabilities_version` (the warm-client
  cache key) but drops the `elapsed_ms` echo; `standard`/`full` add `elapsed_ms`.
  The universal `next_commands` invariant now holds for `compact` and richer;
  `minimal` is the explicit opt-out (still recorded server-side / via diagnostics).
- **Deduped `map_cross_ontology` targets:** multiple rows for the same target id
  (an OBO xref plus an SSSOM mapping, or two predicates) collapse into **one entry
  per `object_id`** carrying the strongest `predicate`/`origin` and a `predicates`
  list (only when >1) — mirroring the `resolve_xref` fix. The wasteful
  `source: null` of OBO xrefs is dropped. Fewer tokens, same information.
- **Cross-reference target labels:** cross-references now carry the target term's
  human-readable `name` when known (from the SSSOM `object_label`, persisted in a
  new `xref.object_label` column; schema v2). So `map_cross_ontology` /
  `get_disease.xrefs` answer "what *is* OMIM:182212" without a follow-up call;
  OBO-only targets simply omit `name`. The repository reads the column tolerantly,
  so an index built before v2 keeps working (label absent, no crash).
- **Value-vs-name errors disambiguated:** a wrong **type** on a known argument (e.g.
  `prefixes="OMIM"` instead of `["OMIM"]`) now reports the expected type with a
  concrete example (`expects an array, e.g. ["OMIM", "ORPHA"]`) and carries the
  shape in `allowed_values` — no longer dumping the list of valid argument *names*
  (which is reserved for genuinely unknown arguments).
- **`error_rate` noise suppressed:** `get_diagnostics.runtime.error_rate` is
  withheld (`null`) until the sample is meaningful (≥20 requests); raw
  `requests`/`errors` counts are always reported. A single early failure no longer
  reads as an alarming ratio.
- **Acronym resolution (verified + locked):** clinical acronyms that live as Mondo
  synonyms (e.g. `ADPKD`) resolve via the exact-synonym path regardless of case;
  regression coverage now guards the case-insensitive acronym path.

### Added

- **Acronym / fuzzy resolution:** `resolve_disease` now falls back to a
  conservative FTS match (`match_type: "fuzzy"`) for a near-miss or acronym-like
  label with no exact id/xref/label match. It resolves only a clear single winner
  (absolute score floor + dominance over the runner-up); a near-tie returns
  `ambiguous_query` with candidates, and anything weaker returns `not_found` with
  suggestions. `get_disease` stays strict (non-fuzzy) so record retrieval never
  silently guesses.
- **Batch tools:** `resolve_disease_batch(queries=[...])` and
  `get_disease_batch(terms=[...], fields=)` resolve/fetch up to 50 items in one
  round trip with **partial success** — each item returns its record or its own
  `ok=false`/`error_code`/`message`, and the call never fails wholesale (an
  over-cap call returns a single `invalid_input`).
- **Deploy-freshness guard:** `scripts/check_deployed_freshness.py` plus
  `make verify-deploy URL=<server>/diagnostics` fail a deploy whose live
  `build.git_sha` does not match local HEAD — the recurrence guard against
  shipping a green local tree whose fixes never reached the container.
- Regression coverage for the `ambiguous_query` path (a label shared by two
  distinct Mondo terms), end-to-end through the facade envelope.

### Fixed

- **Output-schema leak (P0):** `get_disease.xrefs` and `map_cross_ontology.mappings`
  are grouped-by-prefix objects but were declared as `array` in their
  `output_schema`, so FastMCP rejected the tool's own valid output and surfaced a
  raw `{...} is not of type 'array'` string instead of an envelope. Schemas now
  declare the grouped-object shape. A new `tests/unit/test_output_schemas.py`
  round-trips every tool's real output (all response modes + error cases) through
  its declared `output_schema`, so this class of drift fails CI.
- `resolve_xref.total` reported only the returned page size (never the full match
  count), so it could silently truncate without setting `truncated`; it now uses a
  true distinct-term count.
- **`resolve_xref` row/total mismatch:** a term reachable via several mapping rows
  for the same external id (e.g. an OBO `equivalentTo` xref plus an SSSOM
  `exactMatch`) was returned once per row, so `returned` could exceed the
  distinct-term `total` and break a client paging off `total`. The reverse lookup
  now collapses to **one row per distinct Mondo term** (keeping its strongest
  predicate), so `returned <= total` always holds and offset-paging advances by
  whole terms.
- **`get_server_capabilities` missing `_meta.next_commands`:** the discovery root
  omitted `next_commands`, contradicting both the universal `_meta` invariant and
  its own `per_call_meta` contract (which lists `next_commands` as guaranteed). It
  now chains into the canonical `resolve_disease` → record workflow plus a
  `get_diagnostics` freshness check.
- **Human-disease prior in fuzzy resolve:** a one-character typo like
  `resolve_disease("Marfan syndrom")` could surface Mondo's veterinary terms
  ("Marfan syndrome, FBN1-related, pig/cattle") above the canonical human term,
  because those names score higher in raw FTS. Fuzzy hits are now fetched in a
  larger pool and stably re-ranked so non-human-animal terms (descendants of
  `MONDO:0005583`) sink below human terms — livestock no longer leads the
  candidates, and a dominant human term resolves cleanly. Genuinely non-human-only
  queries are unaffected (demotion is a no-op when every hit is non-human).

### Changed

- **Documented batch cap:** `capabilities.limits` now advertises
  `max_batch_items` (50) alongside the search/closure/xref limits, sourced from a
  single `constants.MAX_BATCH_ITEMS` shared by the batch tools and the discovery
  surface — previously the cap was discoverable only by tripping it.

### Added

- **Forward pagination (P2):** `search_diseases`, `get_disease_ancestors`,
  `get_disease_descendants`, and `resolve_xref` accept `offset=` and return
  `offset` + `next_offset`; when truncated, `_meta.next_commands` includes a
  ready-to-call forward-page step that advances `offset` without re-sending rows
  (alongside the existing widen step).
- **`capabilities_version` (P2):** a content hash of the discovery contract is
  echoed in every `_meta` (and in `get_server_capabilities`); a warm client diffs
  it to skip re-fetching capabilities while unchanged.
- **Sparse fieldsets (P2):** `get_disease` and `map_cross_ontology` accept
  `fields=[...]` (top-level keys, or dotted into a group e.g. `xrefs.OMIM`);
  identity anchors are always returned.
- **Runtime metrics (P3):** `get_diagnostics` now returns a `runtime` block with
  request/error counts and latency percentiles (p50/p95/p99) from an in-process
  collector.

### Changed

- **Slimmer `search_diseases` (P1):** compact (default) now returns
  `mondo_id + name + score + definition_snippet` (≤140 chars); the full definition
  is reserved for `standard`/`full`, cutting tokens on the broadest-fan-out tool.
- **Answer-embedding `not_found` (P1):** a free-text label miss now attaches the
  closest search hits as `candidates` and chains `_meta.next_commands` straight to
  `get_disease` on the top hit, instead of merely routing back to the search tool.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- **MCP `serverInfo.version` now advertises the package version, not FastMCP's.**
  `create_mondo_mcp()` built its `FastMCP(...)` instance without a `version=`
  argument, so the MCP `initialize` handshake reported the FastMCP framework
  version (e.g. `3.4.2`) as the server version. It now passes
  `version=__version__`, so `serverInfo.version` matches the `mondo-link`
  package version and the existing `/health` endpoint.

### Changed

- **Single-source versioning.** `mondo_link.__version__` is now derived from the
  installed package metadata (`importlib.metadata.version("mondo-link")`) instead
  of a hardcoded literal that had drifted to `0.1.0`. `pyproject.toml`
  `[project].version` is now the sole source of truth; a new guard test
  (`tests/unit/test_version_single_source.py`) asserts that the pyproject
  version, installed metadata, `__version__`, and `create_mondo_mcp().version`
  are all one value, preventing future drift.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Initial release of `mondo-link`, an MCP + REST server grounding disease work
  in the Mondo Disease Ontology.
- **Data plane:** conditional-GET downloader (ETag / Last-Modified) for the
  Mondo OBO + SSSOM Monarch PURLs; `fcntl` build lock; OBO + SSSOM parser with
  transitive `is_a` closure and top-grouping derivation; atomic SQLite builder
  (temp + `os.replace`) with a `meta` provenance table; `mondo-link-data`
  CLI (`build` / `refresh` / `status`).
- **Index:** terms, labels, synonyms, definitions, `is_a` closure, top
  groupings, and a merged OBO + SSSOM cross-reference table with provenance and
  mapping predicate (OMIM / Orphanet / DOID / NCIT / UMLS / MeSH / MedGen /
  SNOMED / GARD), plus deprecated / `replaced_by` handling.
- **MCP plane:** 11 read-only tools — `get_server_capabilities`,
  `get_diagnostics`, `resolve_disease`, `search_diseases`, `get_disease`,
  `get_disease_ancestors`, `get_disease_descendants`, `get_disease_parents`,
  `get_disease_children`, `resolve_xref`, `map_cross_ontology` — each with
  `output_schema`, `READ_ONLY_OPEN_WORLD` annotations, `response_mode`, and
  `_meta.next_commands`. 7-code structured error taxonomy returned via the
  envelope; `mondo://` discovery resources.
- **Server:** FastAPI + uvicorn unified server (`/health` + `/mcp`) and a stdio
  entry point (`mcp_server.py`) for Claude Desktop.
- Docs, Docker, Makefile, and a `make ci-local` gate (ruff format/lint, 500-line
  budget, mypy strict, pytest with ≥80% coverage).
